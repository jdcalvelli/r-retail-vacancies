# r-retail-vacancies
TO-DO
1. run it with multiple keywords - like a predetermined list of keywords
2. cron job to pull every month, save old data set in old data set, and new data set in new and see what the difference is?
3. refactor so API call is separate from creation of appended dataframe
4. refactor so code is less ugly?
5. figure out distribution method - host on shinyapps.io? package as an executable with electron?
